# Relay Control and Command Runner Scripts
<img src="CH340_relay_race.png" alt="CH340 Relay Race" style="width:50%;">


This repository contains two Python scripts for controlling relay modules and automating command execution. The `relay_control.py` script is used for controlling relays via a serial interface, while `run_commands.py` automates the execution of a series of commands from a file.

## relay_control.py

This script provides functionality for controlling relay modules via a serial interface. It supports ad-hoc command-line control and automated control via an input file.

### Features

- Control individual relays on/off for specified durations
- Read relay control sequences from an input file for automation
- Command line based, easy to integrate with other systems

### Requirements

- Python 3
- pyserial package

### Usage Examples

- Command line (Linux):

````sh
python3 relay_control.py -d '/dev/ttyUSB0' -r 1 -t 5
````

- Command line (Windows):

````sh
python relay_control.py -d COM1 -b 9600 -r 1 -t 1
````

- With input file:

````sh
python relay_control.py -f playfile.txt
````

## run_commands.py

A script to automate the execution of a series of commands listed in a specified file. It can execute the commands a specified number of times or continuously in an infinite loop.

### Features

- Execute commands from a file
- Supports finite or infinite execution cycles
- Useful for repetitive tasks and automation

### Usage Examples

- Finite number of cycles:

````sh
python run_commands.py commands.txt 10
````

- Infinite execution:

````sh
python run_commands.py commands.txt infinite
````

## Installation

### Do This First
Save yourself a lot of headache. Let's use `/dev/ttyUSB0` as the reference CH340 device:

````sh
# Disconnect USB device if connected
sudo systemctl mask brltty-udev.service
sudo apt-get remove --yes brltty
# Reconnect USB device if disconnected
sudo chmod 0666 /dev/ttyUSB0
````

We test everything in Ubuntu (currently 22.04). For Windows, youâ€™d probably need to run as Administrator.

### Download The Source
To use these scripts, clone this repository or download the scripts directly. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

````sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/relay-automation.git
cd relay-automation
pip uninstall serial
pip install pyserial
````

## Usage

### relay_control.py

Run the script with the required arguments. For example:

````sh
python relay_control.py -d COM1 -b 9600 -r 1 -t 1
````

### run_commands.py

Create a file (e.g., `commands.txt`) with each command on a new line and run the script:

````sh
python run_commands.py commands.txt 10
````

For infinite execution:

````sh
python run_commands.py commands.txt infinite
````
